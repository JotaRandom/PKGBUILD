.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Command line options (commands and switches) provide control of creating and managing archives with RAR. The command is a string (or a single letter) which commands RAR to perform a corresponding action.Switches are designed to modify the way RAR performs the action. Other parameters are archive name and files to be archived into or extracted from the archive.

Listfiles are plain text files that contain names of files to process. File names should start at the first column. It is possible to put comments to the listfile after // characters. For example,you may create backup.lst containing the following strings:

    /home/username/doc/*.txt        //backup text documents
    /home/username/pictures/*.bmp   //backup pictures
    /home/username/misc

and then run:

     rar a backup @backup.lst

If you wish to read file names from stdin (standard input), specify the empty listfile name (just @).

By default, Windows console RAR uses OEM (DOS) encoding in list files.
but it can be redefined with \-sc<charset>l switch.

You may specify both usual file names and list files in the same command line. If neither files nor listfiles are specified, then *.* is implied and RAR will process all files

Many RAR commands, such as extraction, test or list, allow to use wildcards in archive name. If no extension is specified in archive mask, RAR assumes .rar, so * means all archives with .rar extension.If you need to process all archives without extension, use *. mask. *.* mask selects all files. Wildcards in archive name are not allowed when archiving and deleting.

In Unix you need to enclose RAR command line parameters containing wildcards in single or double quotes to prevent their expansion by Unix shell. For exemple, this command will extract *.asm files from all *.rar archives in current directory :

     rar e '*.rar' '*.asm'

.SH "COMMAND"
\fBa\fR      Add files to archive.
.TP 
.LP 
\fIExamples\fR:

1) add all *.hlp files from the current directory to the archive
.br 
   help.rar:
.br 

   rar a help *.hlp
.br 

2) archive all files from the current directory and subdirecto\-
.br 
   ries to 362000 bytes size solid, self\-extracting volumes and
.br 
   add the recovery record to each volume:
.br 

   rar a \-r \-v362 \-s \-sfx \-rr save
.br 

   Because no file names are specified, all files (*) are
.br 
   assumed.
.br 

3) as a special exception, if directory name is specified as an 
.br 
   argument and if directory name does not include file masks 
.br 
   and trailing backslashes, the entire contents of the directo\-
.br 
   ry and all subdirectories will be added to the archive even
.br 
   if switch \-r is not specified.
.br 

   The following command will add all files from the directory
.br 
   Bitmaps and its subdirectories to the RAR archive Pictures
.br 
   .rar :
.br 
            
   rar a Pictures.rar Bitmaps
.br 

4) if directory name includes file masks or trailing backsla\-
.br 
   shes, normal rules apply and you need to specify switch \-r 
.br 
   to process its subdirectories. 
.br 

   The following command will add all files from directory Bit\-
.br 
   maps, but not from its subdirectories, because switch \-r is
.br 
   not specified:
.br 

   rar a Pictures.rar Bitmaps\\*

\fBch\fR     Change archive parameters.
.br 

This command can be used with most of archive modification switches to modify
archive parameters. It is especially convenient for switches like \-av, \-cl, \-cu, \-tl, which do not have a dedicated command.
.br 

It is not able to recompress, encrypt or decrypt archive data and it cannot merge or create volumes. If used without any switches, 'ch' command just copies the archive data without modification.
.TP 
.LP 
\fIExample\fR:
.br 

Set archive time to latest file:

   rar ch \-tl files.rar
.TP 
.RP

\fBcw\fR     Write archive comment to specified file.
.br 

Format of output file depends on \-sc switch.

.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fBr\fR      Repair archive. Archive repairing is performed in two stages. First, the damaged
.br 
archive is searched for a recovery record (see 'rr' command). If the archive contains a recovery record and if the portion of the damaged data is continuous and less than N*512 bytes, where N is number of recovery sectors placed into the archive, the chance of successful archive reconstruction is very high. When this stage has been completed, a new archive will be created, called fixed.arcname.rar, where 'arcname' is the original (damaged) archive name.
.br 

If a broken archive does not contain a recovery record or if the archive is not completely recovered due to major damage, a second stage is performed. During this stage only the archive structure is reconstructed and it is impossible to recover files which fail the CRC validation, it is still possible, however, to recover undamaged files, which were inaccessible due to the broken archive structure. Mostly this is useful for non\-solid archives.This stage is never efficient for archives with encrypted file headers, which can be repaired only if recovery record is present.
.br 

When the second stage is completed, the reconstructed archive will be saved as rebuilt.arcname.rar, where 'arcname' is the original archive name.
.br 

While the recovery is in progress, RAR may prompt the user for assistance when a suspicious file is detected.
.br 

                      Suspicious entry
.br 

              Name:  <possibly filename>
.br 
              Size:  <size>    Packed: <compressed size>
.br 

                      Add it: Yes/No/All
.br 

Answer 'y' to add this entry to the file rebuilt.arcname.rar.
.TP 
.LP 
\fIExample\fR:
.br 

  rar r buggy.rar
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fBrc\fR     Reconstruct missing and damaged volumes using recovery volumes (.rev files).
.br 
You need to specify any existing volume as the archive name, for example, 'rar rc backup.part03.rar'
.br 

Read 'rv' command description for information about recovery volumes.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fBrn\fR     Rename archived files.
.br 

The command syntax is:
.br 

  rar rn <arcname> <srcname1> <destname1>...<srcnameN> <destnameN>
.br 

For example, the following command:
.br 

  rar rn data.rar readme.txt readme.bak info.txt info.bak
.br 

will rename readme.txt to readme.bak and info.txt to info.bak in the archive data.rar.
.br 

It is allowed to use wildcards in the source and destination names for simple name transformations like changing file extensions. For example:
.br 

  rar rn data.rar *.txt *.bak
.br 

will rename all *.txt files to *.bak.
.br 

RAR does not check if the destination file name is already present in the archive, so you need to be careful to avoid duplicated names. It is especially important when using wildcards. Such a command is potentially dangerous, because a wrong wildcard may corrupt all archived names.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fBrr[N]\fR  Add data recovery record. Optionally, redundant information (recovery record) may
.br 
be added to an archive. This will cause a small increase of the archive size and helps to recover archived files in case of disk failure or data losses of any other kind, provided that damage is not too severe.
.br 

A recovery record contains up to 524288 recovery sectors. The number of sectors may be specified directly in the 'rr' command (N = 1, 2 .. 524288) or, if it is not specified by the user, it will be selected automatically according to the archive size: a size of the recovery information will be about 1% of the total archive size, usually allowing the recovery of up to 0.6% of the total archive size of continuously damaged data.
.br 

It is also possible to specify the recovery record size in percent to the archive size. Just append the percent character to the command parameter. For example:
.br 

  rar rr3% arcname
.br 

Note that if you run this command from .bat or .cmd file, you need to use rr3%% instead of rr3%, because the command processor treats the single '%' character as the start of a batch file parameter. You may also use 'p' instead of '%', so 'rr3p' will work too.
.br 

If data is damaged continuously, then each rr\-sector helps to recover 512 bytes of damaged information. This value may be lower in cases of multiple damage.
.br 

The size of the recovery record may be approximately determined by the formula <archive size>/256 + <number of recovery sectors>*512 bytes.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fBrv[N]\fR  Create recovery volumes (.rev files), which can be later used to reconstruct mis\-
.br 
sing and damaged files in a volume set. This command makes sense only for multivolume archives and you need to specify the name of the first volume in the set as the archive name. For example:
.br 

  rar rv3 data.part01.rar
.br 

This feature may be useful for backups or, for example, when you posted a multivolume archive to a newsgroup and a part of subscribers did not receive some of the files. Reposting recovery volumes instead of usual volumes may reduce the total number of files to repost.
.br 

Each recovery volume is able to reconstruct one missing or damaged RAR volume. For example, if you have 30 volumes and 3 recovery volumes, you are able to reconstruct any 3 missing volumes. If the number of .rev files is less than the number of missing volumes, reconstructing is impossible. The total number of usual and recovery volumes must not exceed 255.
.br 

Original RAR volumes must not be modified after creating recovery volumes. Recovery algorithm uses data stored both in REV files and in RAR volumes to rebuild missing RAR volumes. So if you modify RAR volumes, for example, lock them, after creating REV files, recovery process will fail.
.br 

The optional <N> parameter specifies a number of recovery volumes to create and must be less than the total number of RAR volumes in the set. You may also append a percent character to this parameter, in such case the number of creating .rev files will be equal to this percent taken from the total number of RAR volumes. For example:
.br 

  rar rv15% data.part01.rar
.br 

RAR reconstructs missing and damaged volumes either when using 'rc' command or automatically, if it cannot locate the next volume and finds the required number of .rev files when unpacking.
.br 

Original copies of damaged volumes are renamed to *.bad before reconstruction. For example, volname.part03.rar will be renamed to volname.part03.rar.bad.

.RP

\fBs[name]\fR Convert archive to SFX. The archive is merged with a SFX module (using a module
.br 
in file default.sfx or specified in the switch). In the Windows version default.sfx should be placed in the same directory as the rar.exe, in Unix \- in the user's home directory, in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib.

\fBv[t,b]\fR Verbosely list the contents of archive [technical].
.br 
Files are listed using the format: full pathname, file comment, original and compressed size, compression ratio, last update date and time, attributes, CRC, compression method and minimum RAR version required to extract.
.br 

Compression method information is displayed as m<N><d>.N shows the file compression method and uses same values  as \-m<n> switch, where '0', '1', ..., '5' mean 'store', 'fastest', ..., 'best'. 'd' indicates the compression  dictionary, as in \-md<n> switch, where 'a', 'b', ..., 'g'  mean 64 KB, 128 KB, ..., 4096 KB. Directories always have '0' compression method and no dictionary size.
.br 

Optional technical information such as "Host OS", "Solid" and "Old" flags is displayed, when 't' modifier is used. "Host OS" shows the native operating system of RAR version used to create an archive. "Solid" flag is set if file uses the compression statistics from preceding files (see \-s switch). "Old" flag means "Old file version" and indicates if it is the latest or old file version (see \-ver switch for details).
.br 

Modifier 'b' forces RAR to output only bare file names without any additional information.
.br 

To list the contents of all archive volumes, use an asterisk ('*') in place of the archive file extension or use the '\-v' switch.

\fB\-\-\fR     Stop switches scanning
.br 

This switch tells to RAR that there are no more switches in the command line. It could be useful, if either archive or file name starts from '\-' character. Without '\-\-' switch such a name would be treated as a switch.
.TP

\fB\-@[+]\fR  Disable [enable] file lists
.br 

RAR treats command line parameters starting from '@' character as file lists. So by default, RAR attempts to read 'filename'  filelist, when encountering '@filename' parameter.B ut if '@filename' file exists, RAR treats the parameter
as '@filename' file instead of reading the file list.
.br 

Switch \-@[+] allows to avoid this ambiguity and strictly define how to handle parameters starting from '@' character.
.br 

If you specify \-@, all such parameters found after this switch will be considered as file lists, not file names.

\fB\-ag[format]\fR
.br 
Generate archive name using the current date and time.
.br 

Appends the current date string to an archive name when creating an archive. Useful for daily backups.
.br 

Format of the appending string is defined by the optional"format" parameter or by "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS" if this parameter is absent. The format string may include the following characters:
.br 

  Y   \- year
.br 
  M   \- month
.br 
  MMM \- month name as text string (Jan, Feb, etc.)
.br 
  W   \- a week number (a week starts with Monday)
.br 
  A   \- day of week number (Monday is 1, Sunday \- 7)
.br 
  D   \- day of month
.br 
  E   \- day of year
.br 
  H   \- hours
.br 
  M   \- minutes (treated as minutes if encountered after hours)
.br 
  S   \- seconds
.br 
  N   \- archive number. RAR searches for already existing archive
.br 
        with generated name and if found, increments the archive
.br 
        number until generating a unique name. 'N' format charac\-
.br 
        ter is not supported when creating volumes.
.br 

Each of format string characters listed above represents only one character added to archive name. For example, use WW for two digit week number or YYYY to define four digit year.
.br 

If the first character in the format string is '+', positions of the date string and base archive name are exchanged, so a date will precede an archive name.
.br 

The format string may contain optional text enclosed in '{' and '}' characters. This text is inserted into archive name.
.br 

All other characters are added to an archive name without changes.
.br 

If you need to update an already existing archive, be careful with \-ag switch. Depending on the format string and time passed since previous \-ag use, generated and existing archive names may mismatch. In this case RAR will create or open a new archive instead of processing the already existing one.You may use \-log switch to write the generated archive name to a file and then read it from file for further processing.

.TP 
.LP 
\fIExamples\fR:
.br 

1) use the default YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format
.br 

   rar a \-ag backup

4) use YYYY\-WW\-A format, include fields description
.br 

   rar a \-agYYYY{year}\-WW{week}\-A{wday} backup

\fB\-ai\fR    Ignore file attributes.
.br 

If this switch is used when extracting, RAR does not set general file attributes stored in archive to extracted files. This switch preserves attributes assigned by operating system to a newly created file.
.br 

In Windows it affects archive, system, hidden and read\-only attributes. In Unix \- user, group, and others file permissions.

\fB\-ap\fR    Set path inside archive. This path is merged to file names when adding files to
.br

.br 

  rar a \-apDOCS\\ENG release readme.txt
.br 

or to extract 'ENG' to the current directory:
.br 

  rar x \-apDOCS release DOCS\\ENG\\*.*
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fB\-as\fR    Synchronize archive contents
.br 

If this switch is used when archiving, those archived files which are not present in the list of the currently added files, will be deleted from the archive. It is convenient to use this switch in combination with \-u (update) to synchronize contents of an archive and an archiving directory.
.br 

For example, after the command:
.br 

  rar a \-u \-as backup sources\\*.cpp
.br 

the archive 'backup.rar' will contain only *.cpp files from directory 'sources', all other files will be deleted from the archive. It looks similar to creating a new archive, but with one important exception: if no files are modified since the last backup, the operation is performed much faster than the creation of a new archive.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fB\-av\fR    Put authenticity verification \fB(registered versions only)\fR.
.br 
RAR will put, in every new and updated archive, information concerning the creator, last update time and archive name.
.br 

If an archive, containing authenticity verification, is being modified and this switch is not specified, the authenticity verification information will be removed.
.br 

When extracting, testing, listing or updating an archive with the '\-av' switch, RAR will perform integrity validation and display the message:
.br 

  Verifying authenticity information ...
.br 

In the case of successful authenticity verification, message 'Ok', creator name and last update information will be displayed. In the case of authenticity verification failure, message 'FAILED' will be displayed.
.br 

RAR authenticity verification can be forged and does not provide the same level of security as modern digital signature schemes based on public key infrastructure. We recommend to use this RAR feature as informational only, like a special archive comment. Avoid it in situations, when accurate information about archive creator is important.
.br 

In order to enable the authenticity verification feature, the program must be registered. Please contact your local distribution site or the world\-wide distribution center.

\fB\-dw\fR    Wipe files after archiving
.br 

Delete files after archiving. Before deleting file data are overwritten by zero bytes to prevent recovery of deleted files.

\fB\-ed\fR    Do not add empty directories
.br 

This switch indicates that directory records are not to be stored in the created archive. When extracting such archives, RAR creates non\-empty directories basing on paths of files contained in them. Information about empty directories is lost. All attributes of non\-empty directories except a name (access rights, streams, etc.) will be lost as well, so use this switch only if you do not need to preserve such information.

\fB\-en\fR    Do not add "end of archive" block
.br 

By default, RAR adds an "end of archive" block to the end of a new or updated archive. It allows to skip external data like digital signatures safely, but in some special cases it may be useful to disable this feature. For example, if an archive is transferred between two systems via an unreliable link and at the same time a sender adds new files to it, it may be important to be sure that the already received file part will not be modified on the other end between transfer sessions.
.br 

This switch cannot be used with volumes, because the end of archive block contains information important for correct volume processing.

\fB\-ep\fR    Exclude paths from names. This switch enables files to be added to an archive

all files and directories from the directory tmp will be added to the archive 'test', but the path in archived names will not include 'tmp\\'
.br 

  rar a \-ep1 \-r test tmp\\*

path separator) when archiving.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fB\-ep3\fR   Expand paths to full including the drive letter.\fBWindows version only\fR.
.br 
.br 

This switch stores full file paths including the drive letter if used when archiving. Drive separators (colons) are replaced by underscore characters.
.br 

If you use \-ep3 when extracting, it will change underscores back to colons and create unpacked files in their original directories and disks. If the user also specified a destination path, it will be ignored.
.br 

It also converts UNC paths from \\server\share to __server\share when archiving and restores them to the original state when extracting.
.br 

This switch can help to backup several disks to the same archive. For example, you may run:
.br 

  rar a \-ep3 \-r backup.rar c:\\ d:\\ e:\\
.br 

to create backup and:
.br 

  rar x \-ep3 backup.rar
.br 

to restore it.
.br 

But be cautious and use \-ep3 only if you are sure that extracting archive does not contain any malicious files. In other words, use it if you have created an archive yourself or completely trust its author. This switch allows to overwrite any file in any location on your computer including important system files and should normally be used only for the purpose of backup and restore.
.TP 
.RP

\fB\-e[+]<attr>\fR
.br 
Specifies file exclude or include attributes mask.
.br 

<attr> is a number in the decimal, octal (with leading '0') or hex (with leading '0x') format.
.br 

By default, without '+' sign before <attr>, this switch defines the exclude mask. So if result of bitwise AND between <attr> and file attributes is nonzero, file would not be processed.
.br 

If '+' sign is present, it specifies the include mask. Only those files which have at least one attribute specified in the mask will be processed.
.br 

In Windows version is also possible to use symbols D, S, H, A and R instead of a digital mask to denote directories and files with system, hidden, archive and read\-only attributes. The order in which the attributes are given is not significant.Unix version supports D and V symbols to define directory  and device attributes.
.br 

It is allowed to specify both \-e<attr> and \-e+<attr> in the same command line.
.TP 
.LP 
\fIExamples\fR:
.br 

1) archive only directory names without their contents
.br 

   rar a \-r \-e+d dirs

.TP 
.RP

\fB\-f\fR     Freshen files. May be used with archive extraction or creation.
.br 

The command string "a \-f" is equivalent to the command 'f', you could also use the switch '\-f' with the commands 'm' or 'mf'. If the switch '\-f' is used with the commands 'x' or 'e', then only old files would be replaced with new versions extracted from the archive.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fB\-hp[p]\fR Encrypt both file data and headers.
.br 

This switch is similar to \-p[p], but switch \-p encrypts only file data and leaves other information like file names visible. This switch encrypts all sensitive archive areas including file data, file names, sizes, attributes, comments and other blocks, so it provides a higher security level. Without a password it is impossible to view even the list of files in archive encrypted with \-hp.
.TP 
.LP 
\fIExample\fR:
.br 

  rar a \-hpfGzq5yKw secret report.txt

.br 

Attach an archive created or updated by the add command to email message. You need to have a MAPI compliant email to email message. You need to have a MAPI compliant email client to use this switch (most modern email programs support MAPI interface).
.br 

You may enter a destination email address directly in the switch or leave it blank. In the latter case you will be asked for it by your email program. It is possible to specify several addresses separated by commas or semicolons.
.br 

If you append a dot character to \-ieml, an archive will be deleted after it was successfully attached to an email. If the switch is used when creating a multivolume archive, every volume is attached to a separate email message.

Write error messages to rar.log file. If optional 'name' parameter is not specified, the log file is created using the following defaults:
.br 

Unix:    .rarlog file in the user's home directory;
.br 
Windows: rar.log file in %APPDATA%\\WinRAR directory;
.br 

If 'name' parameter includes a file name without path, RAR will create the log file in default directory from the list above using the specified name. Include both path and name to 'name' parameter if you wish to change the location of log file.

.br 

\fB\-log[fmt][=name]\fR     
.br 
Write names to log file.
.br 

This switch allows to write archive and file names to specified text file in archiving, extracting, deleting and listing commands. Its behavior is defined by 'fmt' string, which can include one or more of following characters:
.br 

   A \- write archive names to log file. If RAR creates or processes
.br 
       volumes, all volume names are logged.
.br 

   F \- write processed file names to log file. It includes files added
.br 
       to archive and extracted, deleted or listed files inside of archives.
.br 

   P \- if log file with specified name is exist, append data to existing file
.br 
       instead of creating a new one.
.br 

   U \- write data in Unicode format.
.br 

If neither 'A' nor 'F' are specified, 'A' is assumed.
.br 

'name' parameter allows to specify the name of log file. It must be separated from 'fmt' string by '=' character.If 'name' is not present, RAR will use the default rarinfo.log  file name.
.br 

It is allowed to specify several \-log switches in the same command line.
.br 

This switch can be particularly useful, when you need to process an archive created with \-ag or \-v switches in a batch script.You can specify \-loga=arcname.txt when creating an archive and then read an archive name generated by RAR from arcname.txt with an appropriate command. For example, in Windows batch file it can be: set /p name=<arcname.txt.
.TP

.br 
  \-m5   best      use best compression method (slightly more, but
.br 
  			 slowest)
.br 

If this switch is not specified, RAR uses \-m3 method (normal compression)
.br 

By default, RAR uses only the general compression algorithm in \-m1 and \-m2 methods, advanced algorithms like audio and true color processing are enabled only in \-m3..\-m5 modes, the advanced text compression is activated only in \-m4..\-m5. This default can be overridden using \-mc switch.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fB\-mc<par><n>\fR
.br 
Set advanced compression parameters.
.br 

This switch is intended mainly for benchmarking and experiments. In the real environment it is usually better to allow RAR to select optimal parameters automatically. Please note that improper use of this switch may lead to very serious performance and compression loss, so use it only if you clearly understand what you do.
.br 

It has the following syntax:
.br 

  \-mc[param1][:param2][module][+ or \-]
.br 

where <module> is the one character field denoting a part of the compression algorithm, which has to be configured.
.br 

It may have the following values:
.br 

  A       \- audio compression;
.br 
  C       \- true color (RGB) data compression;
.br 
  D       \- delta compression;
.br 
  E       \- 32\-bit x86 executables compression;
.br 
  I       \- 64\-bit Intel Itanium executables compression;
.br 
  T       \- text compression.
.br 

'+' sign at the end of switch applies the selected algorithm module to all processed data, '\-' disables the module at all. If no sign is specified, RAR will choose modules automatically, based on data and the current compression method.
.br 

Switch \-mc\- disables all optional modules and allows only the general compression algorithm.
.br 

<Param1> and <Param2> are module dependent parameters described below.
.br 

Audio compression, delta compression:
.br 

<Param1> is a number of byte channels (can be 1 \- 31). RAR splits multibyte channels to bytes, for example, two 16\-bit audio channels are considered by RAR as four channels one byte each.
.br 

<Param2> is ignored.
.br 

32\-bit x86 Intel executables compression,
.br 
64\-bit Intel Itanium executables compression,
.br 
true color (RGB) data compression:
.br 

<Param1> and <Param2> are ignored.
.br 

Text compression: 
.br 

<Param1> is the order of PPM algorithm (can be 2 \- 63). Usually a higher value slightly increases the compression ratio of redundant data, but only if enough memory is available to PPM. In case of lack of memory the result may be negative. Higher order values decrease both compression and decompression speed.
.br 

<Param2> is memory in megabytes allocated for PPM (1\-128). Higher values may increase the compression ratio, but note that PPM uses the equal memory size both to compress and decompress, so if you allocate too much memory when creating an archive, other people may have problems when decompressing it on a computer with less memory installed. Decompression will be still possible using virtual memory, but it may become very slow.
.TP 
.LP 
\fIExamples\fR:
.br 

1) switch \-mc1a+ forces use of 8\-bit mono audio compression for

.br 
   for all data,  sets the compression order to 10 and alloca\-

.br 

3) switch \-mc12t sets the text compression order to 12, when the

\fB\-md<n>\fR Select dictionary size <n> in KB. Must be 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 or
.br 
4096 or a letter 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g' respectively.
.br 

The sliding dictionary is a special memory area used by the compression algorithm. If the size of the file being compressed (or the total files size in the case of a solid archive) is greater than the dictionary size, then increasing the dictionary size will generally increase compression ratio, decrease packing speed and increase memory requirements.
.br 

RAR can reduce the dictionary size if it is significantly larger than the size of the source data. It helps to reduce memory requirements without decreasing compression.
.br 

Default sliding dictionary size is 4096 KB.

\fB\-ms[list]\fR
.br 
Specify file types to store.
.br 

Specify file types, which will be stored without compression. This switch may be used to store already compressed files, which helps to increase archiving speed without noticeable loss in the compression ratio.
.br 

Optional <list> parameter defines the list of file extensions separated by semicolons. For example, \-msrar;zip;jpg will force RAR to store without compression all RAR and ZIP archives and JPG images. It is also allowed to specify wildcard file masks in the list, so \-ms*.rar;*.zip;*.jpg will work too.
.br 

If <list> is not specified, \-ms switch will use the default set of extensions, which includes the following file types:
.br 

7z, ace, arj, bz2, cab, gz, jpeg, jpg, lha, lzh, mp3, rar, taz, tgz, z, zip
.TP 
.RP 
.br 

\fB\-mt<threads>\fR
.br 
Set the number of threads. \fBAvailable in Windows version only\fR.
.br 

<threads> parameter can take values from 0 to 16. It defines the recommended number of active threads for compression algorithm. If it is greater than 0, RAR will use the multithreaded version of compression algorithm providing higher speed on multiprocessor architectures. Real number of active threads can differ from the specified.
.br 

If <threads> is zero, RAR will use the single threaded compression algorithm.
.br 

Change of <threads> parameter slightly affects the compression ratio, so archives created with different \-mt switches will not be exactly the same even if all other compression settings are equal.
.br 

If \-mt switch is not specified, RAR will try to detect the number of available processors and select the optimal number of threads automatically.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 

\fB\-n<f>\fR  Include only the specified file <f>. Wildcards may be used both in the name
.br 
and file parts of file mask. You may specify the switch '\-n' several times.
.br 

This switch does not replace usual file masks, which still need to be entered in the command line. It is an additional filter limiting processed files only to those matching the include mask specified in \-n switch. It can help to reduce the command line length sometimes.
.br 

For example, if you need to compress all *.txt and *.lst files in directories Project and Info, you can enter:
.br 

  rar a \-r text Project\\*.txt Project\\*.lst Info\\*.txt Info\\*.lst
.br 

or using the switch \-n:

  rar a \-r \-n*.txt \-n*.lst text Project Info
.TP 
.RP

\fB\-n@<lf>\fR Include files listed in the specified list file.

\fB\-r\-\fR    Disable recursion.
.br 

Even without \-r switch RAR can enable the recursion automatically in some situations. Switch \-r\- prohibits it.
.br 

If you specify a directory name when archiving and if such  name does not include wildcards, by default RAR adds the directory contents even if switch \-r is not specified. Also RAR automatically enables the recursion if disk root without wildcards is specified as a file mask. Switch \-r\- disables such behavior.
.TP

.br 

If <p> is 0, RAR uses the default task priority. <p> equal to 1 sets the lowest possible priority, 15 \- the highest possible.
.br 

Sleep time <s> is a value from 0 to 1000 (milliseconds). This is a period of time that RAR gives back to the system after every read or write operation while compressing or extracting. Non\-zero <s> may be useful if you need to reduce system load even more than can be achieved with <p> parameter.

Solid archiving significantly increase compression, when adding a large number of small, similar files. But it also has a few important disadvantages: slower updating of existing solid archives, slower access to individual files, lower damage resistance.

\fB\-sv\fR    Create independent solid volumes
.br 

By default RAR tries to reset solid statistics as soon as possible when starting a new volume, but only if enough data was packed after a previous reset (at least a few megabytes).
.br 

This switch forces RAR to ignore packed data size and attempt to reset statistics for volumes of any size. It decreases compression, but increases chances to extract a part of data if one of several solid volumes in a volume set was lost or damaged.
.br 

Note that sometimes RAR cannot reset statistics even using this switch. For example, it cannot be done when compressing one large file split between several volumes. RAR is able to reset solid statistics only between separate files, but not inside of single file.
.br 

Ignored if used when creating a non\-volume archive.

\fB\-sv\-\fR   Create dependent solid volumes

\fB\-ta<date>\fR
.br 
Process only files modified after the specified date.
.br 

Format of the date string is YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. It is allowed to insert separators like '\-' or ':' to the date string and omit trailing fields. For example, the following switch is correct: \-ta2001\-11\-20 Internally it will be expanded to \-ta20011120000000 and treated as "files modified after 0 hour 0 minutes 0 seconds of 20 November 2001".

\fB\-tn<time>\fR
.br 
Process files newer than the specified time period. Format of the time string is:
.br 

[<ndays>d][<nhours>h][<nminutes>m][<nseconds>s]
.br 

For example, use switch \-tn15d to process files newer than 15 days and \-tn2h30m to process files newer than 2 hours 30 minutes.

.TP 
.RP 
.br 

\fB\-ts<m,c,a>[N]\fR
.br 
Save or restore file time (modification, creation, access).
.br 

Switch \-tsm instructs RAR to save file modification time, \-tsc \- creation time and tsa \- last access time. Optional parameter after the switch is the number between 0 and 4 controlling the file time precision. Value '1' enables 1 second precision, 2 \- 0.0065536 sec, 3 \- 0.0000256 sec and 4 or '+' enables the maximum NTFS time precision, which is equal to 0.0000001 sec. Value '0' or '\-' means that creation and access time are not saved and low (two seconds) precision is used for modification time. Higher precision modes add more data to archive, up to 19 additional bytes per file in case of \-tsm4 \-tsa4 \-tsc4 combination. If no precision is specified, RAR uses '4' (high) value.
.br 

Default RAR mode is \-tsm4 \-tsc0 \-tsa0, so modification time is stored with the high precision and other times are ignored.
.br 

It is necessary to specify \-tsc and \-tsa switches to set creation and access time when unpacking files (precision is irrelevant, but must not be 0). By default RAR sets only the modification time, even if archive contains creation and last access time. Setting the modification time to unpacked files may be also disabled with \-tsm\-.
.br 

It is possible to omit the time type letter if you need to apply the switch to all three times. For example, \-tsm4 \-tsa4 \-tsc4 can be replaced by \-ts4, \-ts+ or \-ts. Use \-ts\- to save only the low precision modification time or to ignore all three file times on unpacking.
.br 

When creating an archive, RAR automatically reduces the precision if high mode is not supported by the file system. It is not more than 2 seconds on FAT and 1 second in Unix. NTFS time precision is 0.0000001 second.
.br 

Operating systems limit which time can be set on unpacking. Windows allows to set all three times, Unix \- modification and last access, but not creation, DOS supports only the modification time.
.TP 
.LP 
\fIExamples\fR:
.br 

1) rar a \-ts backup

.br 

2) rar x \-tsa backup

.br 
   required, because RAR uses it by default.
.br 

3) rar a \-tsm1 \-tsc1 backup

   Store low precision modification and creation time. Without
.br 
   \-tsm1 RAR would save the high precision modification time.

\fB\-u\fR     Update files. May be used with archive extraction or creation.
.br 
The command string "a \-u" is equivalent to the command 'u', you could also use the switch '\-u' with the commands 'm' or 'mf'. If the switch '\-u' is used with the commands 'x' or 'e', then files not present on the disk and files newer than their copies on the disk would extracted from the archive.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fB\-v\fR     Create volumes with size autodetection or list all volumes
.br 

This switch may be used when creating or listing volumes.
.br 

In the first case it enables volume size autodetection, so new volumes will use all available space on the destination media. It is convenient when creating volumes on removable disks. You may read more about volumes in \-v<size> description.
.br 

In the second case, when this switch is used together with 'V' or 'L' command, it forces RAR to list contents of all volumes starting from that specified in the command line. Without this switch RAR displays contents of only one single  specified volume.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fB\-v<size>[k|b|f|m|M|g|G]\fR
.br 
Create volumes with size=<size>*1000 [*1024 | *1]. By default this switch uses <size> as thousands (1000) of bytes (not 1024 x bytes). You may also enter the size in kilobytes using the symbol 'k', in bytes using the symbol 'b', megabytes \- 'm', millions of bytes \- 'M', gigabytes \- 'g', billions (milliards) of bytes \- 'G' or select one of several predefined values using the symbol 'f' following the numerical value. Predefined values can be 360, 720, 1200, 1440 or 2880 and replaced with corresponding floppy disk size.
.br 

If the size is omitted, autodetection will be used.
.br 

It is allowed to enter decimal fractions using the dot as the decimal mark. For example, \-v1.5g means 1.5 gigabytes.
.br 

You may specify several \-v switches to set different sizes for different volumes. For example:
.br 

  rar a \-v100k \-v200k \-v300k arcname
.br 

sets 100 KB size for first volume, 200 KB for second and 300 KB for all following volumes.
.br 

If volumes are created on removable media, then after the creation of the first volume, the user will be prompted with:
.br 

  Create next volume: Yes/No/All
.br 

At this moment in time, you should change the disks. Answering 'A' will cause all volumes to be created without a pause.
.br 

By default RAR volumes have names like 'volname.partNNN.rar', where NNN is the volume number. Using \-vn switch it is possible to switch to another, extension based naming scheme, where the first volume file in a multi\-volume set has the extension .rar, following volumes are numbered from .r00 to .r99.
.br 

When extracting or testing a multi\-volume archive you must use only the first volume name. If there is no next volume on the drive and the disk is removable, the user will be prompted with:
.br 

 Insert disk with <next volume name>
.br 

Insert the disk with the correct volume and press any key.
.br 

If while extracting, the next volume is not found and volumes are placed on the non\-removable disk, RAR will abort with the error message:
.br 

 Cannot find <volume name>
.br 

Archive volumes may not be modified. The commands 'd', 'f', 'u', 's' cannot be used with Multi\-volume sets. The command 'a' may be used only for the creation of a new multi\-volume sequence.
.br 

It is possible, although unlikely, that the file size, of a file in a multi\-volume set, could be greater than its uncompressed size. This is due to the fact that 'storing' (no compression if size increases) cannot be enabled for multi\-volume sets.
.br 

Archive volumes may be Self\-Extracting (SFX). Such an archive should be created using both the '\-v' and '\-sfx' switches.
.TP 
.LP 
\fIExample\fR:
.br 
create archive in volumes of fixed size:
.br 

  rar a \-s \-v1440 floparch.rar *.*
.br 

will create solid volumes of size 1440000 bytes.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fB\-vd\fR    Erase disk contents before creating volume
.br 

All files and directories on the target disk will be erased when '\-vd' is used.  The switch applies only to removable media, the hard disk cannot be erased using this switch.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fB\-ver[n]\fR File version control
.br 

Forces RAR to keep previous file versions when updating files in the already existing archive. Old versions are renamed to 'filename;n', where 'n' is the version number.
.br 

By default, when unpacking an archive without the switch \-ver, RAR extracts only the last added file version, the name of which does not include a numeric suffix. But if you specify a file name exactly, including a version, it will be also unpacked. For example, 'rar x arcname' will unpack only last versions, when 'rar x arcname file.txt;5' will unpack 'file.txt;5', if it is present in the archive.
.br 

If you specify \-ver switch without a parameter when unpacking, RAR will extract all versions of all files that match the entered file mask. In this case a version number is not removed from unpacked file names. You may also extract a concrete file version specifying its number as \-ver parameter. It will tell RAR to unpack only this version and remove a version number from file names. For example, 'rar x \-ver5 arcname' will unpack only 5th file versions.
.br 

If you specify 'n' parameter when archiving, it will limit the maximum number of file versions stored in the archive. Old file versions exceeding this threshold will be removed.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fB\-vn\fR    Use the old style volume naming scheme
.br 

By default RAR volumes have names like 'volname.partNNN.rar', where NNN is the volume number. Using \-vn switch it is possible to switch to another, extension based naming scheme, where the first volume file in a multi\-volume set has the extension .rar, following volumes are numbered from .r00 to .r99.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fB\-vp\fR    Pause before each volume
.br 

By default RAR asks for confirmation before processing next volume only when archiving to removable disks and only  if free disk space is less than volume size. This switch forces RAR to always ask for such confirmation when creating or extracting volumes. For example, it can be useful if you wish to copy new volumes to another media immediately after creating.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fB\-w<p>\fR  Assign work directory as <p>. This switch may be used to assign the directory
.br 
for temporary files.
.TP 
.RP 
.br 


\fB\-x<f>\fR  Exclude specified file <f>, file or directory. Wildcards can be used in both the
.br 
name and path parts of file mask. You may specify the switch '\-x' several times.
.br 

If mask contains wildcards, it applies to files in current directory and its subdirectories. It is not recursive without wildcards, so "filename" mask will exclude some "filename" in all directories, you need to specify two masks: 'filename' file only in current directory when archiving or in root archive directory when extracting.
.br 

Use "*\\filename" syntax to exclude "filename" recursively in all directories.
.br 

If you know the exact path to file, you can use "path\\filename" syntax to exclude only this copy of "filename". If you use \-xpath\\filename syntax when unpacking an archive, "path" must be the path inside of archive, not the file path on the disk after unpacking.
.br 

By default, masks containing wildcards are applied only to files. If you need a mask with wildcards to exclude several directories,use the special syntax for directory exclusion masks.Such masks must have the trailing path separator character ('\\' for Windows and '/' for Unix). For example, "*tmp*\\" mask will exclude all directories matching "*tmp*" and "*\\tmp\\" will exclude all 'tmp' directories. Since wildcards are present,both masks will be applied to contents of current directory and all its subdirectories.
.br 

If you wish to exclude only one directory, specify the exact name of directory including the absolute or relative path without any wildcards. In this case you do not need to append the path separator to mask, which is required only for directory exclusion masks containing wildcards to distinguish them from file exclusion masks.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.br 

Default parameters may be added to the RAR command line by establishing an environment variable "RAR".
.br 

For instance, in Unix following lines may be added to your profile:
.br 

  RAR='\-s \-md1024'
  export RAR
.br 

RAR will use this string as default parameters in the command line and will create "solid" archives with 1024 KB sliding dictionary size.
.br 

RAR handles options with priority as following:
.br 

   command line switches                   highest priority
.br 
   switches in the RAR variable            lower priority
.br 
   switches saved in configuration file    lowest priority
.br 

.SH "LOG FILE"
.br 

If the switch \-ilog is specified in the command line or configuration file, RAR will write informational messages, concerning errors encountered while processing archives, into a log file. Read switch \-ilog description for more details.
.br 

.SH "THE FILE ORDER LIST FOR SOLID ARCHIVING - RARFILES.LST"
.br 

rarfiles.lst contains a user\-defined file list, which tells RAR the order in which to add files to a solid archive. It may contain file names, wildcards and special entry \- $default. The default entry defines the place in order list for files not matched with other entries in this file. The comment character is ';'.
.br 

In Windows this file should be placed in the same directory as RAR  or in %APPDATA%\\WinRAR directory, in Unix \- to the user's home directory or in /etc.
.br 

Tips to provide improved compression and speed of operation:
.br 

\- similar files should be grouped together in the archive;
.br 
\- frequently accessed files should be placed at the beginning.
.br 

Normally masks placed nearer to the top of list have a higher priority, but there is an exception from this rule. If rarfiles.lst contains such two masks that all files matched by one mask are also matched by another, that mask which matches a smaller subset of file names will have higher priority regardless of its position in the list. For example, if you have *.cpp and f*.cpp masks, f*.cpp has a higher priority, so the position of 'filename.cpp' will be chosen according to 'f*.cpp', not '*.cpp'.
