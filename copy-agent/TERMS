Pricing Terms and Conditions

Upgraded Accounts

Copy offers you the option of increasing your account storage space beyond 5 GB for a fee. By doing so, your account will be converted to a Premium Account and will not be subject to some of the restrictions placed on Free Accounts as described below.

Copy accepts credit cards and will automatically charge your credit card monthly or yearly, depending upon which Premium Account you select. If any fee is not paid in a timely manner, or Copy is unable to process your transaction using the credit card information provided, Copy reserves the right to revoke access to your Copy account and reserves the right to use our discretion to delete some or all of Your data so as to reduce your storage space to below 2 GB, and to convert your Premium Account to a Free Account (which is subject to the restrictions described below).

Billing

The fees for your Upgraded Account will be billed from the date you elect, or convert to, a Upgraded Account and on each monthly or yearly renewal thereafter unless and until you cancel your account. Click on the link on your "Account" page to see the commencement date for your next renewal period. Copy will automatically bill your credit card each month or year on the anniversary of the commencement of your Upgraded Account. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month or year may vary for reasons that include, differing amounts due to promotional offers, differing amounts due to changes in your account, or changes in the amount of applicable sales tax, and you authorize us to charge your credit card for such varying amounts. Copy may also periodically authorize your credit card in anticipation of account or related charges. All fees and charges are noncancelable and nonrefundable and no credits will be given for partially used periods.

Should you elect to increase your Upgraded Account to a larger amount of storage space, the commencement date for your next renewal period will be reset and you will be billed for the first month or year of the upgraded level of service on a pro-rata basis.

Copy may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by email or on the website. If you want to use a different credit card or if there is a change in your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your information by accessing your "Account" page. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information and payment information current and updated.

Cancelling Your Account

Your Copy Upgraded Account will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your Upgraded Account or we terminate it. You must cancel your Upgraded Account before it renews each month or year in order to avoid billing of the next month's or year's fees to your credit card. Copy will bill the monthly or yearly fees associated with your Upgraded Account plus any applicable tax to the credit card you provide to us.

You may cancel your Copy Upgraded Account at any time, and cancellation will be effective immediately. If you wish to cancel your Upgraded Account you may do so via your "Account" page. Should you elect to cancel your Upgraded Account, please note that you will not be issued a refund for the most recently (or any previously) charged monthly or annual fees.

By signing up for a Copy Upgraded Account and providing Copy with your payment account information, you hereby agree to these payment terms and conditions.

Free Accounts

Copy allows you to store up to 2 GB free of charge. Copy reserves the right to change the amount of free storage or terminate Free Accounts at any time, with or without notice. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if a Free Account is inactive for ninety (90) days, then Copy may delete any or all of Your Files without providing additional notice.

Term and Termination

This Agreement is effective upon any use and remains in effect until your account is terminated. Terms which by their nature extend beyond termination shall survive termination of this Agreement.

Your right to use Copy automatically terminates if you fail to comply with these Terms. Copy reserves the right to refuse or discontinue participation to any user at any time at its sole discretion. You agree that, upon such termination, you will discontinue all use of the Products and that your access rights will immediately terminate.
